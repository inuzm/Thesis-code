# Thesis code

This respository was created as a means to share the code used for my bachelor's thesis _Mezclas de procesos Dirichlet y su uso para la identificación de temas en un conjunto de textos_, supervised by Dr. [Juan Carlos Martínez-Ovando](https://github.com/jcmartinezovando). The aim is to provide a way to replicate the graphs and results that appear in it. To make it easier, [shell scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) (more on this later) have been provided to show what the workflow was and to streamline it.

In the directory Chapter 2, corresponding to the second chapter of the thesis, which focuses on Statistical Learning, three [R](https://www.r-project.org/) scripts and one shell script are provided to reproduce all of the figures. One can either run evry R script manually or run the shell script.

In the directory Chapter 3, corresponding to the third chapter of the thesis, focusing on Bayesian Statistics, an R script and a shell script are provided to reproduce all of the figures and data of the chapter.
